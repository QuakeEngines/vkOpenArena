# Quake III Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Note: this is an ASCII dump of the http://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/index.php and

Quake III engine is mostly an evolution of idTech2 but there are some interesting novelties. The key points can be summarized as follow: 


* New dualcore renderer with material based shaders.
* New Network model based on snapshots.
* New Virtual Machines playing an essential part in the engine, 
combining Quake1 portability/security with Quake2 speed. This is achieved by compiling the bytecode to x86 instruction on the fly.
* New Artificial Intelligence for the bots.


 
Two important things to understand the design:

1. Every single input (keyboard, win32 message, mouse, UDP socket) is converted into
an event_t and placed in a centralized event queue (sysEvent_t eventQue[256]). This
allows among other things to record (journalize) each inputs in order to recreate
bugs. This design decision was discussed at length in John Carmack's .plan on 
Oct 14, 1998.

2. Explicit split of Client and Server. The explicit split of networking into a
client presentation side and the server logical side was really the right thing
to do. We backed away from that in Doom 3 and through most of Rage, but we are 
migrating back towards it. All of the Tech3 licensees were forced to do somewhat
more work to achieve single player effects with the split architecture, but it 
turns out that the enforced discipline really did have a worthwhile payoff.

3. The server side is responsible for maintaining the state of the game, 
determine what is needed by clients and propagate it over the network. 
It is statically linked against bot.lib which is a separate project


## Memory allocation

Two custom allocators at work here:

* Zone Allocator: Responsible for runtime,small and short-term memory allocations.
* Hunk Allocator: Responsible for on level load, big and long-term allocations from the pak files (geometry,map, textures, animations).



## the Game Modules

### Game
* run on server side
* maintain game state
* compute bots
* move objects

### CGame
* run on client side
* predict player states
* tell sound and gfx renderers what to show

### UI
* run on client side
* show menus



## The Quake III Way for Extensions a Program

### Bytecode
* compiled by special compiler (lcc)
* byte code interpreted by a virtual machine
* strict sandbox, strict memory limit
* main program can catch exceptions and unload VM

### Native
* writen in C and compiler as shared library
* must restrict to embedded libc subset
* must not use external libs(such as malloc)
